## Research and Development

Synrc Research Center has founded <a href="https://groupoid.space">Groupoid Infinity</a> to research the
formal languages and runtimes. We use dependent types as specification langauge
to define datatypes, protocols, and interfaces. Also Groupoid Infinity is doing
research in HoTT and formalization of mathematics.</div>
