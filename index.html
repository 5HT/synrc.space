            <h3>N2O Ecosystem</h3>
            <div>Synrc defines open <a href="https://n2o.space">N2O</a> ecosystem,
                 a full-stack specification and implementation for banking,
                 messaging and platform development. It specifies the way
                 to scale applications, protocols, processes, services, and storage.
                 Ready for high-speed, low-latency IoT, MQTT, TCP, UDP and WebSocket
                 applications, N2O powers <a href="https://pb.ua/depozit"> banks</a>, <a href="https://nynja.io">messaging systems</a>, and several
                 startups around America, Europe and Asia.
            </div>
            <h3>R&D</h3>
            <div>Synrc Research Center has founded <a href="https://groupoid.space">Groupoid Infinity</a> to research the
                 formal languages and runtimes. We use dependent types as specification langauge
                 to define datatypes, protocols, and interfaces. Also Groupoid Infinity is doing
                 research in HoTT and formalization of mathematics.</div>

        <a name=arch><h3>ARCHITECTURE</h3></a>
        <p>Software architecture defines services running in
           your environment using heterogeneous protocols and languages.
           Two crucial services of modern applications are message bus and storage services.
           The message bus along with storage services form a basis of distributed application.</p>
        <p>We also provide expertise in: 1) MQTT, AMQP, XMPP, and other less known
           protocols as for message bus; 2) distributed
           databases, DHT, consistency. Depending on your needs we create simple and
           managable architecture, probably involving other services,
           like auth service, business process management, roster management, etc.
           The result of this phase is an application protocol specification (API),
           and components design.</p>

        <a name=proto><h3>PROTOTYPING</h3></a>
        <p>We create prototypes using Erlang language,
           as it allows the code to be small and concise,
           yet undestandable and manageable by engineers. Usually this
           phase can take couple months. As a result you get a demo of
           runnable proof of concept.</p>

        <a name=train><h3>TRAINING</h3></a>
        <p>We did public and private trainings for
        Crytek, PrivatBank, TecSynt and other companies.
        We have written books, turtorial, articles, and other support
        materials that forms a courses program.</p>
