            <h3>N2O Ecosystem</h3>
            <div>Synrc defines open <a href="https://n2o.space">N2O</a> ecosystem,
                 a full-stack specification and implementation for banking,
                 messaging and platform development. It specifies the way
                 to scale applications, protocols, processes, services, and storage.
                 Ready for high-speed, low-latency IoT, MQTT, TCP, UDP and WebSocket
                 applications, N2O powers banks, messaging systems, and several
                 startups around America, Europe and Asia.
            </div>
            <h3>R&D</h3>
            <div>Synrc Research Center has founded <a href="https://groupoid.space">Groupoid Infinity</a> to research the
                 formal languages and runtimes. We use dependent types as specification langauge
                 to define datatypes, protocols, and interfaces. Also Groupoid Infinity is doing
                 research in HoTT and formalization of mathematics.</div>

        <a name=arch><h3>Architecture</h3></a>
        <p>Software architecture defines services running in
           your environment using heterogeneous protocols and languages.
           Two crucial services for modern applications are messgae bus
           and storage services.</p>
        <p>Locally, the message bus service could be exposed using EMQ or Mosquitto brokers,
           and in clouds by using MQTT IoT at AWS or Azure.
           The second service is a distributed database which is usually installed
           as DHT ring in cloud (S3, DynamoDB, Cosmos DB) or locally (Redis, SQL, Cassandra, Aerospike).</P>
        <p>We also provide expertise in: 1) AMQP, XMPP and other less known
           protocols as for core bus protocols; 2) distributed
           databases. Depending on your needs we create simple and
           managable architecture, probably involving other services,
           like auth service, business process management, etc.
           The result of this phase is protocol specification
           for distributed application.</p>

        <a name=proto><h3>Prototyping</h3></a>
        <p>We create prototypes using Erlang language,
           as it allows the code to be small and concise,
           yet undestandable and manageable by engineers. Usually this
           phase can take couple months. As a result you get a demo of
           runnable proof of concept.</p>

        <a name=train><h3>Training</h3></a>
        <p>We did open and private trainings for
        Crytek, PrivatBank, TecSynt and other less remarkable companies.
        We have written books, turtorial, articles, and other support
        materials forming a courses program.</p>

        <a name=sign><h3>Subscription Contract</h3></a>
        <p>If you want to push our work in your own direction,
           you can contract us to provide paid services for
           your company by commiting to Synrc open source repositories.
           By signing the contract you will unlock the author's supervision,
           architecture lead, core review, and trainings for your team.
